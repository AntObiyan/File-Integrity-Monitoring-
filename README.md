# File-Integrity-Monitoring

## Introduction
**File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)** is a security process that involves monitoring and validating the integrity of operating systems and application software files using a verification method between the current file state and a known, good baseline. This process helps detect any changes to files, which can indicate unauthorized modifications, potential security breaches, or malicious activities. By continuously tracking these changes, FIM helps organizations ensure their critical files remain in their desired state, thereby maintaining the overall security and compliance of their IT environments.
